# Flappy-Bird

I created a game similar to the popular Flappy Bird Game using Processing for Java. This project serves as a fun and simple example of how to use game mechanics and graphics in Java with the Processing library.

## Features
- **Player Controls**: The player controls a bird by pressing the right-click or left-click to make it flap and avoid obstacles.
- **Obstacles**: The game has pipes in a fixed place that the player needs to navigate through to avoid losing.
- **Scoring**: The player earns a point for every pair of pipes they pass successfully.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle or falls to the ground.

## Requirements
To run the game, you need:
- **Java JDK 8 or higher**
- **Processing IDE** (You can download it from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/))

## How to Play
1. Press the right-click or left-click to make the bird flap and stay in the air.
2. Avoid the obstacles (pipes) as they move from right to left.
3. Score a point every time you pass a pair of pipes.
4. The game ends if you hit a pipe or fall to the ground.

## Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then open the project on Processing.
